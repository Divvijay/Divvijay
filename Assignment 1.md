# Block Chain and Cryptocurrencies
The block chain and cryptocurrencies domain under Fintech is selected for the purpose of this study.
## Blockchain
Block chain is not a new technology, rather it is a combination of proven technologies applied in a new way. Blockchain is a unique combination of three technologies viz – the internet, private key cryptography, and a protocol governing incentivization. It is a system for digital transactions that eliminates the need of a trusted centralized third party. Block chain is an idea of cryptographic keys and shared ledgers that incentivizes users to secure and formalize digital relationships. It has applications in many industries such as IT, banking, government bodies, etc. It is an innovative to look at things and system to store digital transactions and/or contracts in a decentralized and secure manner. Whenever a digital transaction happens on a block chain, it creates a unique block - containing a digital signature, timestamp, and relevant information – is then broadcast to all nodes in the network. (Coindesk, n.d.)
Blockchains require massive computing power and there are two types of Blockchains – (i) Public blockchains and (ii) Private Blockchains.  Open, public blockchains requires mining. 
With blockchains, by offering one’s computer processing power to service the network, there is a reward available for one of the computers. A person’s self-interest is being used to help service the public need.
With bitcoin, the goal of the protocol is to eliminate the possibility that the same bitcoin is used in separate transactions at the same time, in such a way that this would be difficult to detect.
This is how bitcoin seeks to act as gold, as property. Bitcoins and their base units (stashes) must be unique to be owned and have value. To achieve this, the nodes serving the network create and maintain a history of transactions for each bitcoin by working to solve proof-of-work mathematical problems.
They basically vote with their CPU power, expressing their agreement about new blocks or rejecting invalid blocks. When most of the miners arrive at the same solution, they add a new block to the chain. This block is timestamped and can also contain data or messages. (Coindesk, n.d.)
Blockchain is like a distributed ledger. They are good for recording both static data (a registry) or dynamic data (transactions), making it an evolution in systems of record.  In its simplest form, a distributed ledger is a database held and updated independently by each participant (or node) in a large network. The distribution is unique: records are not communicated to various nodes by a central authority but are instead independently constructed and held by every node. That is, every single node on the network processes every transaction, coming to its own conclusions and then voting on those conclusions to make certain the majority agree with the conclusions.

Once there is this consensus, the distributed ledger has been updated, and all nodes maintain their own identical copy of the ledger. This architecture allows for a new dexterity as a system of record that goes beyond being a simple database.

 Block chains are also called immutable, because it takes huge effort to change an entry in the database because it would require changing all of the data that comes afterwards, on every single node.
### Applicability of Block Chains
**Block chains are useful when**:
•Data and its history are important to the digital relationships they are helping to establish, then blockchains offer a flexible capacity by enabling many parties to write new entries into a system of record that is also held by many custodians.

•	if existing IT infrastructure featuring accounts and logins is not sufficient for the security of digital identity, then the problem might be solved by blockchain technology.

•	If a database requires millions of dollars to secure lightweight financial transactions, then there is a chance blockchains are good solution to the traditional IT systems. 

•	However, if high performance, millisecond transactions are required, then it’s best to stick with a traditional-model centralized system. Blockchains as databases are slow and there is a cost to storing the data – the processing (or ‘mining’) of every block in a chain. As of now, Centralized data systems based on the client-server model are faster and less expensive.

*Applicability of Block Chain in Finance*

•	One way for the existing banks and financial institutions is that these competing financial institutions could use this common database to keep track of the execution, clearing and settlement of transactions without the need to involve any central database or management system. In short, the banks will be able to formalize and secure digital relationships between themselves in ways they could not before.

•	Block chains could be used to create unique digital assets which can not be copied and this gives them a value. The Bitcoin is epitome example of this concept.

•	This ability, however, extends beyond just recording transactions. Nasdaq, for example, was one of the first to build a platform enabling private companies to issue and trade shares using a blockchain.
•	With paper-world trading, the time frame for clearing and settlement of a transaction is generally referred to as ‘T+3’ – that is, three days after the trade (T), the transaction is settled. With blockchain technology, the entire lifecycle of a trade – execution, clearing and settlement – occurs at the trade stage. With a digital asset, trade is settlement, and the cryptographic keys and digital ownership they control can lower post-trade latency and counterparty risk.

**Some Drawbacks of the Blockchain technology**

•	Blockchain requires a large network of users, however. If a blockchain is not a robust network with a widely distributed grid of nodes, it becomes more difficult to reap the full benefit.

•	If a blockchain is used as a database, the information going into the database needs to be of high quality. The data stored on a blockchain is not inherently trustworthy, so events need to be recorded accurately in the first place. The phrase ‘garbage in, garbage out’ holds true in a blockchain system of record, just as with a centralized database.

## Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a general name referring to all encrypted decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency uses cryptography to create coins and secure transactions. Typically, cryptocurrencies are open source with pubic, but encrypted, ledgers of all transactions based on blockchain technology. Popular cryptocurrencies include the original Bitcoin, Ethereum’s Ether, and Litecoin, and Dodge Coin. As of 2020, cryptocurrency has been used as a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies (which are usually backed by some central government) such as the US dollar (USD). Meanwhile, cryptocurrency technology, including smart contracts and blockchain, has been used for several other purposes such as apps, cloud computing, and more. 

## Major Trends in Cryptocurrency space
Digital currency starts in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto (an anonymous person and/or group) released their paper detailing what would become Bitcoin. Bitcoin became the first decentralized digital coin when it was created in 2008. It then went public in 2009. As of 2020, Bitcoin is the most commonly known and used cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, other coins including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and more are all notable mentions.

•	As of January 2015, there were over 500 different types of cryptocurrencies – or altcoins – for trade in online markets. However, only 10 of them had market capitalizations over $10 million. (Crytocurrency facts.com, n.d.)

•	As of September 2017, there were over 1,100 cryptocurrencies and the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached an all-time high surpassing $60 billion! Then, by December 2017, the total market cap reached $600 billion (a multiple of 10 in only two months). (Crytocurrency facts.com, n.d.)

•	As of April 2021, there were over 6,700 cryptocurrencies and the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached an all-time high surpassing $2 trillion!

•	The total amount of coins continues to grow while the market cap ebbs and flows, but one can clearly see the direction of the trend over time toward more coins and a higher total market cap. (Crytocurrency facts.com, n.d.)

•	Although the future is uncertain, cryptocurrency is proving itself to be more than just a fad. Today cryptocurrency is shaping up to be a growing market that (despite the pros and cons) is likely here for the long haul. (Crytocurrency facts.com, n.d.)
